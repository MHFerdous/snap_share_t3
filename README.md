<!-- During the development of CraftyBay, several challenges were encountered, including:

 - User Authentication: Overcoming the challenge of securely saving and managing user tokens to ensure data privacy and user account protection.

 - Navigation Design: Creating an intuitive and user-friendly navigation system that helps users easily access their cart, wishlist, and additional options.

## How Challenges Were Overcome
 - **Will be update later.**
<!-- To address these challenges, several strategies and solutions were implemented:

 - User Authentication: Rigorous security measures were put in place to safeguard user tokens, ensuring that user accounts and data are protected from unauthorized access.

 - Navigation Design: Extensive user testing and feedback collection were conducted to refine the app's navigation, making it as intuitive as possible for users to access their cart, wishlist, and other options.

 - State Management: We implemented a robust state management system, utilizing tools and libraries such as GetX or the built-in setState mechanism, depending on the app's architecture. This allowed us to efficiently manage the app's state, ensuring data consistency and responsiveness.

 - Reducing API calls: To optimize app performance, we've reduced the number of API calls where data is fetched and updated only when needed, reducing app data consumption and enhancing user experience.

CraftyBay is continuously evolving to enhance the shopping experience for users, and your feedback and contributions are welcome. Thank you for considering CraftyBay for your ecommerce needs! -->
